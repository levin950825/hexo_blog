A command-line coursera downloader written in Python.

You can download the script from my GitHub repo here: https://github.com/yingchi/coursera-downloader

When learning wonderful modules on Coursera, I found it quite frustrating when I need to click multiple places and move back and forth to download the learning materials for one course. 

After searching around, I found 2 github repo that can help people to download course materials from Coursera. However, one of the repo stopped updating and another is not very convenient to use. 

So I decided to combine the good features from them and write a new downloading tool. You will need your Coursera email and password if you use the script, but don't worry, they are encrypted and saved into a local file.
