## Welcome ;)

<p style="font-size:16px"> Glad you are here. ðŸ˜‰ </p> <p style="font-size:16px">My name is Pei Yingchi (è‹±æ± ), currently a young data scientist at DataSpark. Graduated from NUS with a Business Analytics degree, I thrive to be a great data miner, to uncover business insights, and to build practical applications. You can find more about my experience on my [home page](https://www.peiyingchi.com). </p> <p style="font-size:16px">I created this place to record down my learning notes and random thoughts. 
Feel free to drop me an email and talk about anything. I'd love to hear from you. </p>
